### Installing Radix

Radix is currently under heavy development, but can be installed by running either of these commands:

```
npm install @test/radix
```

or

```
yarn add @test/radix
```

### Radix Provider

Make sure to wrap your app in `RadixProvider` to get the default theme:

```js
import { RadixProvider } from '@test/radix';

const App = () => <RadixProvider>Hey thereðŸ‘‹</RadixProvider>;
```

### Importing components from Radix

All components can be imported directly:

```js
import { Heading, Text, Link } from '@test/radix';
```
